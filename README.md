# DA-Project-2019

## Introduction
This project simulates a real world phenomenon.  It utilises Python [1], NumPy [5] and jupyter [4] packages. 

There are 4 distinct tasks:

- Choose a real world phenomenon that can be measured.

- Investigate the variables involved.

- Simulate that dataset.

- Detailed research and implemented simulation in Jupyter notebook.

## Project Plan

- Choose a real world phenomenon
- Research and understand the dataset
- Choose variables 
- Match variables to a distribution
- Analyse variables and their inter relationships
- Devise an algorithm or method to synthesise those variables
- Generate dataset

Prerequisites

- Install Anaconda for the complete suite of python libraries and add on packages.

https://www.anaconda.com/download/

- Run the Jupyter Notebook
- Open the Jupyter notebook.
- On the menu, select Kernel, then select "restart and run all". 
This will run the programs in the notebook.
